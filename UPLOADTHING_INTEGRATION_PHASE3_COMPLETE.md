# UploadThing Integration - Phase 3 Complete

## Backend Changes Made:

### 1. Updated FileManager Service (`services/file_manager.py`)
- **Added UploadThing Support**: New async methods for saving presentations with UploadThing
- **Dual Storage Strategy**: Supports both UploadThing and legacy local file storage
- **New Methods Added**:
  - `save_presentation_async()` - Async version with UploadThing support
  - `delete_presentation_async()` - Async deletion with UploadThing file cleanup
  - `get_presentation_download_url()` - Gets download URL (UploadThing or local)
  - `get_presentation_file_content()` - Retrieves file content for legacy files
  - `_save_presentation_uploadthing()` - Internal UploadThing save logic
  - `_save_presentation_legacy()` - Internal legacy save logic

### 2. Updated Export Handler (`api/routers/presentation/handlers/export_as_pptx.py`)
- **UploadThing Integration**: Now uses `save_presentation_async()` with UploadThing enabled
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to legacy storage if UploadThing fails

### 3. New File Management Endpoints (`routers/files.py`)
- **Added Download Endpoint**: `/files/presentations/{presentation_id}/download`
  - Supports both UploadThing URLs (redirect) and legacy files (direct serve)
- **Updated Delete Endpoint**: Now uses async deletion for UploadThing support
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require user authentication

## Frontend Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Type Definitions (`app/dashboard/types.ts`)
- **Enhanced Presentation Interface**: Added UploadThing fields
  - `uploadthing_url`, `uploadthing_key`
  - `uploadthing_thumbnail_url`, `uploadthing_thumbnail_key`
  - `file_size`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Retains legacy fields (`file_path`, `thumbnail_path`)

### 2. Updated Dashboard API (`app/dashboard/api/dashboard.ts`)
- **New Auth Endpoint**: Now uses `/files/my-presentations` instead of `/ppt/user_presentations`
- **Type Transformation**: Maps backend response to frontend presentation model
- **Download Support**: Added `downloadPresentation()` method
- **UploadThing URLs**: Properly handles UploadThing URLs vs legacy file paths

### 3. Updated UI Components
- **PresentationCard**: Added download button in the context menu
- **Download Logic**: Smart handling of UploadThing URLs vs legacy files
- **Type Safety**: All components now use proper TypeScript interfaces

## Features Implemented:

✅ **Dual Storage System**: New presentations use UploadThing, legacy presentations still work
✅ **User Authentication**: All file operations require user authentication
✅ **Download Support**: Users can download presentations (both UploadThing and legacy)
✅ **Delete Support**: Proper cleanup of both UploadThing and local files
✅ **Fallback Handling**: UploadThing failures fall back to legacy storage
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all new interfaces
✅ **UI Integration**: Dashboard shows download option for all presentations

## Database Schema:

✅ **Migration Applied**: Added UploadThing fields to `presentation` table
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing presentations continue to work
✅ **New Field Support**: 
  - `uploadthing_url` (main download URL)
  - `uploadthing_key` (for deletion)
  - `uploadthing_thumbnail_url` (thumbnail display)
  - `uploadthing_thumbnail_key` (thumbnail deletion)
  - `file_size` (file size tracking)

## Testing Status:

✅ **Backend Import Test**: FileManager and routers import successfully
✅ **Frontend Build Test**: Next.js builds without TypeScript errors
✅ **Database Migration**: Alembic migration applied successfully

## Next Steps for Testing:

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure UploadThing API keys
2. **End-to-End Test**: Generate a new presentation and verify UploadThing storage
3. **Download Test**: Test download functionality for both UploadThing and legacy files
4. **Delete Test**: Verify proper cleanup of UploadThing files
5. **Authentication Test**: Ensure user-specific file access works correctly

## Configuration Required:

### Backend (.env):
```
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=ut_xxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Frontend (.env.local):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The integration is now complete and ready for testing with actual UploadThing credentials!
